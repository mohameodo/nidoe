> 🎬 **NIDOE** — A next-gen video platform built for creators, rebels, and people who are done with boring-ass platforms.

## ⚡ What is NIDOE?

**NIDOE** is a fully open-source, customizable video-sharing app with a clean modern UI, flexible layouts, and creator-first tools.  
It’s not a clone — it’s a *level-up*. Think uploads, monetization, badges, creator studio, and a UI so fresh it slaps.

> ⚠️ **This app is currently in development and will be made public soon.**  
> Stay tuned. You’re not ready. 👀
